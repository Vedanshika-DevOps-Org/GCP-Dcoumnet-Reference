âœ… What is IAP?
Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) is a Google Cloud security service that:
Controls access to VMs, apps, and resources based on user identity and context.
Allows SSH and RDP to VMs that donâ€™t have external IPs.
Uses Googleâ€™s managed tunnels for secure, zero-trust access.


âœ… Why Use IAP?
ðŸ”’ Benefits:
No External IP Needed: Keep VMs fully private.
Fine-Grained Access: Based on Google IAM roles.
Logging: All access is logged in Cloud Audit Logs.
Simple User Management: Add/remove access using Google IAM.
No VPN Needed: Google automatically creates secure tunnels.
